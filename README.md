# 3dengine
*Despite the name, this is actually 2D for now. 3D may come someday.*

This is my standalone effort to build a game engine (or more like a game framework) using only some core libraries, like OpenGL, GLFW.

**Update 14/08/19:**
The project will be put on hold in favor of another project with a friend of mine, using SDL. I'll be back.

### Current state:
2D Rendering, sprite and audio loading, audio playback, normalized memory allocations.

### TODO next:
Audio streaming
